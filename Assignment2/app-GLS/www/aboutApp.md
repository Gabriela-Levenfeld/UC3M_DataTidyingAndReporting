# Handwritten Digit Recognition App

This application is designed for applying machine learning techniques to identify and predict handwritten digits from image files.

## Understanding the task

Handwritten digit recognition is the process of identifying and interpreting human handwriting. This task can be particularly challenging due to the diverse styles and imperfections in human handwriting. This app aims to tackle these challenges by employing a variety of machine learning models.
