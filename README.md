# Data Tidying and Reporting

This repository contains the two assignments for the Data Tidying and Reporting course at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M).

- **Assignment 1**: Digit classification using ridge logistic model.

- **Assignment 2**: Shiny app development that allows users to upload and evaluate images from the MNIST dataset.

## About dataset
The  Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset contains over 60.000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (from 0 to 9), stored as collections of pixel values. It is divided into two subsets: training set with 30.950 images and a testing set with 30.405 examples. For the purposes of the assignments, both tasks use the same dataset stored in the `qmnist_nist.RData` file.
